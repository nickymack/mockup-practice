    <p>Here is a picture of some fancy butternut squash.  It sure does look nice, doesn't it?  I wouldn't suggest buying a whole squash and peeling it yourself, though.  Even though it's a little more expensive, it's totally worth it to just buy frozen diced butternut squash because it takes forever to peel it and cut it up.  Pluse for some reason when you cut this type of squash it releases this weird goo-type stuff that can really make your hands feel weird.  So you should wear gloves when dealing with these anyway.  Last time I tried to peel a butternut squash I accidentally peeled off part of my thumb and it was the most annoying cut I had in a long time.

    <p>If you like avocados, then you probably like this picture, too.  Someone would probably write up a whole description about these avocados and how they make them and why they are so great, etc. ect.  This is an article about the avocados.

    <p>So these are actually zucchini muffins.  They are probably sort of healthy I guess.  I just thought it was a nice picture and that it was coherent with the rest of the pictures in that it has that bright vibrant look to it.  I don't really have much to say about it because I'm just trying to fill up text so that the page shows what actual text would look like.

    <p>Wow!  What a fancy, fancy sandwhich!  This looks like something that would cost around $16, and is probably not even that great tasting, but it looks nice.  It features some nice colors, which go well with the rest of this page.  So that is why I picked it.  Okay well I'm just going to type some more words now so that I can keep filling this out.
